# LaserDefender

## How to Install

1. Install Unity Hub 2021.3.16f1 at least
2. Open Unity Hub and Open the folder you cloned that I have provided in this repository.
3. The project should open with the appropriate packages installed. If there are errors, open the project in a more recent editor, the editor of my choice was 2022.3.5f1.
4. In the Game window, change the aspect ratio to 9:16.
